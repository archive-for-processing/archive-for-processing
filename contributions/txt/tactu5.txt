name = tactu5

# List of authors. Links can be provided using the syntax [author name](url).
authorList = [Alessandro Capozzo](http://www.abstract-codex.net)

# A web page for your library, NOT a direct link to where to download it.

# The category of your library, must be one (or many) of the following:
#   "3D"            "Animation"     "Compilations"      "Data"          
#   "Fabrication"   "Geometry"      "GUI"               "Hardware"      
#   "I/O"           "Language"      "Math"              "Simulation"    
#   "Sound"         "Utilities"     "Typography"        "Video & Vision"
# 
# If a value other than those listed is used, your library will listed as 
# "Other".
category = Sound

# A short sentence (or fragment) to summarize the library's function. This will 
# be shown from inside the PDE when the library is being installed. Avoid 
# repeating the name of your library here. Also, avoid saying anything redundant 
# like mentioning that it's a library. This should start with a capitalized 
# letter, and end with a period.
sentence = Tactu5 aids in the creation of algorithmic music in real time. It consists of a set of classes focused on defining musical elements, utility classes and an aggregator.

# Additional information suitable for the Processing website. The value of
# 'sentence' always will be prepended, so you should start by writing the
# second sentence here. If your library only works on certain operating systems,
# mention it here.
paragraph = Tactu5 does not include a built-in synthesis system and is not focused on a specific communication protocol. Tactu5 has been designed to be quite easily integrated with existing software synthesis systems (Csound, PureData, SuperCollider etc.) through network communication (for instance, [oscP5](http://www.sojamo.de/libraries/oscP5/)) or by directly using some Java binding.

# Links in the 'sentence' and 'paragraph' attributes can be inserted using the
# same syntax as for authors. 
# That is, [here is a link to Processing](http://processing.org/)


# A version number that increments once with each release. This is used to 
# compare different versions of the same library, and check if an update is 
# available. You should think of it as a counter, counting the total number of 
# releases you've had.
version = 4  # This must be parsable as an int

# The version as the user will see it. If blank, the version attribute will be 
# used here.
prettyVersion = 1.0.2  # This is treated as a String
