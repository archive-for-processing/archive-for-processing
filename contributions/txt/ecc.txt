# The category (or categories) of your tool, must be from the following list:
#   "3D"            "Animation"     "Compilations"      "Data"          
#   "Fabrication"   "Geometry"      "GUI"               "Hardware"

# If a value other than those listed is used, your library will listed as

# A short sentence (or fragment) to summarize the tool's function. This will be
# shown from inside the PDE when the tool is being installed. Avoid repeating
# the name of your tool here. Also, avoid saying anything redundant like
# mentioning that it's a tool. This should start with a capitalized letter, and
# end with a period.
sentence = Extended code completion for statements like if, while and for etc.

# Additional information suitable for the Processing website. The value of
# 'sentence' always will be prepended, so you should start by writing the
# second sentence here. If your tool only works on certain operating systems,
# mention it here.
paragraph =  The principle of Extended Code Completion is based on the principle that you write something and then presses ctrl+space to expand it, e.g. write if and press ctrl+space and it will expand to if(){ }

# Links in the 'sentence' and 'paragraph' attributes can be inserted using the
# same syntax as for authors. 
# That is, [here is a link to Processing](http://processing.org/)

# A version number that increments once with each release. This is used to 
# compare different versions of the same tool, and check if an update is 
# available. You should think of it as a counter, counting the total number of 
# releases you've had.

# The version as the user will see it. If blank, the version attribute will be

prettyVersion = 1.1.0  # This is treated as a String

# The min and max revision of Processing compatible with your tool.
# Note that these fields use the revision and not the version of Processing, 
# parsable as an int. For example, the revision number for 2.2.1 is 227. 
# You can find the revision numbers in the change log: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/processing/processing/master/build/shared/revisions.txt
# Only use maxRevision (or minRevision), when your tool is known to break in a 
# later (or earlier) release. Otherwise, use the default value 0.
