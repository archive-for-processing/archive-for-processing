# The category (or categories) of your Library, must be from the following list:
#   "3D"            "Animation"     "Compilations"      "Data"

# A short sentence (or fragment) to summarize the Library's function. This will 
# be shown from inside the PDE when the Library is being installed. Avoid 
# repeating the name of your Library here. Also, avoid saying anything redundant 
# like mentioning that it's a Library. This should start with a capitalized 
# letter, and end with a period.
sentence = a toolkit for sensing people in spaces with phones.

# Additional information suitable for the Processing website. The value of
# 'sentence' always will be prepended, so you should start by writing the
# second sentence here. If your Library only works on certain operating systems,
# mention it here.
paragraph = With tramontanaCV you will be able to harness the computing power of your phone to sense people (among other things) in space and broadcast the result to a Processing sketch..

# That is, [here is a link to Processing](http://processing.org/)

# A version number that increments once with each release. This is used to 
# compare different versions of the same Library, and check if an update is 
# available. You should think of it as a counter, counting the total number of 
# releases you've had.

prettyVersion = 1.1

# The min and max revision of Processing compatible with your Library.
# Note that these fields use the revision and not the version of Processing, 
# parsable as an int. For example, the revision number for 2.2.1 is 227. 
# You can find the revision numbers in the change log: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/processing/processing/master/build/shared/revisions.txt
# Only use maxRevision (or minRevision), when your Library is known to 
# break in a later (or earlier) release. Otherwise, use the default value 0.
