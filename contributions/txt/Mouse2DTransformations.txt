sentence = Calculation of mouse coordinates in transformed 2D animation matrices.
paragraph = Processing's reserved keywords "mouseX" & "mouseY" store the mouse coordinates with respect to the upper left corner of the sketch. When no transformations (i.e. translate(), scale(), rotate(), pushMatrix(), popMatrix()) are applied, these coordinates refer to the actual position in the animation matrix. However, when transformations are applied, this relation no longer holds. With this library, one can get the actual position of the mouse in both transformed and non transformed animation matrices.
