# A short sentence (or fragment) to summarize the tool's function. This will be

# end with a period.

# Additional information suitable for the Processing website. The value of
# 'sentence' always will be prepended, so you should start by writing the
# second sentence here. If your tool only works on certain operating systems,
# mention it here.
paragraph = This application was created as a developer tool to aid in the creation of Processing sketches. Various shapes can be drawn and edited on screen. The export option can be used output the processing code to your clipboard or to create an image or SVG file. 

# Links in the 'sentence' and 'paragraph' attributes can be inserted using the
# same syntax as for authors. 
# That is, [here is a link to Processing](http://processing.org/)

# Only use maxRevision (or minRevision), when your tool is known to break in a
