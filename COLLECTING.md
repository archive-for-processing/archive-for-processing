# Collecting

Notes on collecting for the Archive for Processing project.

## Forked Libraries

(i.e. Libraries that are GitHub-forked from the processing library template)

The GitHub library template was created long prior to the GitHub implementation of a "template" repo copying feature.

https://github.com/processing/processing-library-template

As a result, most GitHub repos for Processing libraries are "forks." A limitation of GitHub is that one account cannot create multiple fork repos from the same tree. For this reason, the Archive for Processing GitHub account may make a fork of the template...

https://github.com/archive-for-processing/processing-library-template

...but it may not then fork any of the ~60 original libraries which are forks of that template. Only one may be chosen.
