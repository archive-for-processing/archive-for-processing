# Archive for Processing

Archive for Processing is an (unofficial) archive of resources for the Processing community.

It is intended to make the distributed ecosystem of open source libraries, modes, tools, example sets, and documentation a bit more robust.

This GitHub organization account does so by providing simple mirroring via a list of forked GitHub repositories. These forks help guard against future project loss, and in particular make availabile the work by former contributors who have moved on from the Processing community and no longer maintain their associated accounts, websites, et cetera.

This archive contains both inactive and active projects -- it includes forks of ongoing, under-development repositories. When viewing a repository in the archive, **FIRST CHECK THE SOURCE REPO** linked under the title, if that original source exists. The archival forks may be out-of-date, with an up-to-date version being developed by the original author or maintainer. Forks for active repositories do not automatically update -- they are snapshots that must be periodically refreshed.

The repository forks here are not maintained in any way, even if the original is no longer available. As such, they do not accept issues, comments, etc. They are available to fork for interested developers, including future volunteer maintainers.

This independent initiative is not an official project of the Processing Foundation.
